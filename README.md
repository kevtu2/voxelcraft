# Voxelcraft
Voxelcraft is a clone of the popular indie game called Minecraft, originally created by [Notch](https://x.com/notch?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) and [Mojang Studios](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/meet-mojang-studios).

## About The Project
The project is built with C++ and OpenGL. I wanted to use this as an opportunity to strengthen my skills in C++ and learn more about OpenGL. I also love Minecraft, so I thought that this would be a great challenge for me. ðŸ˜º
## Current Features
* Features are underway. I am currently working on adding world lighting (hopefully will be quick) and then moving back to terrain generation to make it more realistic [May 15, 2025].
* I am planning on adding more features in the future such as:
  - [x] Chunk loading
  - [x] Terrain & world generation
  - [x] Lighting
  - [ ] Player & block collisions
  - [ ] ImGui integration for metrics
  - [ ] Day and night cycle
  - [ ] Block placement/destruction
  - [ ] Gameplay aspects such as a health bar, inventory, etc.
  - [ ] Cool world destruction superpowers (For gameplay)
